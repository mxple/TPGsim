# TPGsim (no longer maintained)
This is a practice tool for RotMG Shatter's "Test of Patience" phase. Speed, health points, defense, and difficulty are all adjustable. 

In addition, there is both a solo mode and a group mode. In solo mode, the shades will aggro the player while in group mode, the shades will move as if being dragged in a large raid.

## How to use
For Windows, go to [releases](https://github.com/Mxple/TPGsim/releases) and download the latest version (.zip). Unzip it and it should work out of the box.

For Mac users, download the latest .dmg file. You will encounter an "application is damaged..." error when trying to open it. This is due to Apple requiring developers to pay them in order to release applications. To open:
1. First drag the application into the Applications folder
2. Next, open the terminal and enter: `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine '/Applications/TPGsim.app'`
3. Done! You should be able to launch it now

Thank you to [u/CoolioDood](https://www.reddit.com/r/RotMG/comments/xq2bn2/comment/iq957x0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for this workaround!

If you wish to build from the source code, download this repository as a zip, and use Gamemaker Studio 2.3+ to compile the project from the yyz.

## Tips
Hold shift while clicking to increment stats quicker. There is no end to this simulator - if you die, the game just restarts. You can judge whether you finished a patience by counting the number of drags. 3 for normal, 4 for hard mode.
Screen rotate is available as well as camera offset. All controls are default for now. QOL changes may or may not be expected.

## FAQ
Q: I don't like the default skin, will you add more skin options?
